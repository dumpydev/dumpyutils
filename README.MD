## Self host
In order to self host the bot, you will need some dependencies
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) >=v16    
- yarn `npm i -g yarn`      
- [git](https://git-scm.com)  
Now, clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/dumpydev/dumpyutils.git
```  
Change directories into the folder, and run `yarn` this will install all the extra dependencies.    
Now, create a file named `.env` in your **root** folder. Open the file and write ```TOKEN=*insert token*```
You can now run `node .` to start the bot.
